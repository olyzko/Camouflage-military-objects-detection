# Streamlit App for Apples Detection

In this repo, you will find an end-to-end computer vision app created using Streamlit. I have created a simple streamlit application by extendeding the code created for my previous [blogpost](https://shrishailsgajbhar.github.io/post/OpenCV-Apple-detection-counting).

Please find the demo video for the application [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M158qUE-zio).

## Requirements

Install `pipreqs` package for getting the `requirements.txt` automatically. Run `pipreqs .` in root path to generate the file.

## How to run

* Clone the repo and create a python virtual environment
* Install the required packages
* Run the code by executing the following command at terminal
  
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
